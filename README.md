# Work-Day-Scheduler

This repo was created for week 5 homework of Georgia Tech's Coding Boot Camp. 

We were given starter code and were asked to make a calendar for 8AM-5AM which stored our activities for each time frame in local storage and displayed
when the page was refreshed. The time blocks were also instructed to be color coded based on what time it currently is. 

Here is my github pages link: https://smonahan1993.github.io/Work-Day-Scheduler/

And here is a screen shot of the app:
